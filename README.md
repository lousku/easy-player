# easy-player

This simple python script allows raspberry pi user to create simple two-button music player. Button connected to pin7 is used to start and stop audio. Button connected to pin 11 is used to change to next audiotrack. Depending on used hardware(large buttons), this application could be used by elderly people who have problems with modern audioplayers.

TODO:
Make button pressing event based,
new implementation to replace hardcoded songlist.
